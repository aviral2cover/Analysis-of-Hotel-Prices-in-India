# Analysis of Hotel Prices in India

## Aim:

This project analyzes data gathered from more than 1000 hotels spread scross 42 Indian cities to predict the major factors that influence the hotel prices across the nation.

# Objectives: 

The major objectives of this report are as follows: 
1. Identification of factors that drive up the hotel room rents. These factors may be identified based on both machine and human interpretation via: 
  * Correlations shown from Tests and Data Models 
  * Manager Intuition in identifying correlations amongst the variables 
2. Run analysis on the selected variables to verify their correlations 
3. Form Regression Models on the selected variables 

## Tools:

The entire analysis of this dataset was done on RStudio Version which has the underlying R Language version. RStudio provides a very useful tool for working with R and is the most widely used enterprise ready tool used in the industry. The dataset itself was obtained as csv files segregated by cities. They were then consolidated in R into a single data frame to run analysis on it collectively. 

## Conclusion:

Most influential variables according to the analysis run on the dataset of these 42 cities were found to be: 

* Star rating 
* Swimming pool 
* Hotel Capacity 

This research helps us identify the major factors which can affect the consumer prices for a service industry. It gives us a clear picture of which factors influence the pricing of rooms in the Hotel Industry in India. As expected, the Star Rating and Premium Facilities offered by a Hotel affect its average room prices. Apart from this, as with any other market the ‘supply’ (available rooms in terms of Hotel Capacity) also determines the premium charged for a room.
